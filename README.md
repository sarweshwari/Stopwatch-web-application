Stopwatch web application 
I developed a fully functional stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application features start, stop, and reset buttons, displaying elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds. JavaScript handles the timing logic, while CSS provides a clean and responsive design. I'm considering adding features like lap tracking, millisecond precision, and dark mode for an enhanced user experience.
